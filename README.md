Initial dump of code from my Summer 2017 internship.

I wrote most of the code initially; however, this source dump is from a few
months after I left.  It looks like it has gained some improvements; in
particular, the tests were written by someone else.  Even the code that I wrote
benefited from code review and discussions with my manager and other coworkers,
who deserve credit.

Note that it was forked from
https://github.com/benediktschmitt/py-jsonapi/tree/dev-schema, although most of
it has been almost completely rewritten.

Licensed under Apache 2; the code it was forked from was MIT licensed.  That is
why there are two sets of headers.
